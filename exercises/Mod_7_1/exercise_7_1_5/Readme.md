//Instructions

Print only the even numbers from an array [100,0] in descending order

//Steps

I have decided to first create the array [0,100]

Then I sorted it so the array reads [100,0]

After, I pushed the first element and every other second element into a new array

Once this has been achieved, the program prints both arrays on the screen
