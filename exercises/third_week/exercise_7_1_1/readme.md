Create a program in which the user enters three notes and the program calculates the average.

If the average is less than 5, the following message should be displayed on the screen: “You have not passed the course. You have to recover”.

If the average is between 5 and 7 it should show: “Congratulations! You have passed but you should continue practicing”.

If the average is higher than 7 it should show: “Congratulations! You have passed the course! Go to the next level now!
