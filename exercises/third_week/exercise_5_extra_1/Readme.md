Instructions:

    Built a game where the user can guess a random number N between 1 & 500.

        If the distance between the number to be guessed & the user´s number is 50 or more, the program should say:
        "Cold, cold: your number is bigger" or "Cold, cold: your number is smaller"

        If the distance between the number to be guessed & the user´s number is between 15 & 50, the program should say:
        "Warm, warm: your number is bigger" or "Warm, warm: your number is smaller".

        And if the distance between the number to be guessed & the user´s number is smaller than 15, the program should say:
        "Hot, hot: your number is bigger" or "Hot, hot: your number is smaller".

        The game ends when the user guesses the random number.
