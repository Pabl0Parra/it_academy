A teacher wants to calculate the average grades for the entire class. Create an application where the user will enter a number on the screen (the number corresponds to the number of grades you want to enter) and the program will ask you to enter the grades of all the students.

Once the notes have been entered, the program returns the following:

    If the average grade is less than 5: "The average grade of the class is suspended. Students should ask their questions and work more."

    If the mark is lower than 7: "The average mark of the class is good, but the students should improve their personal work."

    For all other cases, the message should be: "Congratulations! The average grade of the class is great!

Remember: Marks must be between 0 and 10.
