A group of friends is going to make a fideuá, whose main ingredients will be: noodles, shrimp, and squid. They know that for every four people, they must use half a kilo of noodles, 400 grams of squid and 200 grams of shrimp. The program will ask on the screen for the price per kilo of each ingredient and the number of friends that will be for lunch. The program must calculate the necessary amounts of each ingredient, the price per person and the final price of the fideuá.
